### Introduction about me

Hello all, my name is **Hasan Tummalei**, I am a fresh PharmD graduate from ***Jordan University of Science and Technology*** (***JUST***). I am 25 years old, I am passionate about computers and decided lately to hop in the boat and learn programming so my target is to become a full stack web developer.I love kittens I love video games in my free time!

### Conclusion about what we've learned today

Today we've learned a lot of fundemental yet useful information in dealing with our machines, first we've learned about the difference between **CLI** and **GUI**, and as the teacher mentioned it will be more preferrable for us in the future to deal with coding using **CLI**, then we've been taugh about some terminal main commands like `cd` , `mkdir` ,`touch`. then we've learned about git and github and what is the difference between them, it's more like *git* is local and *github* is the online place we push our data from out local machine to make a restorable data. then we made our personal accounts on github and create our SSH to clone our bunch of directories (repositories) from the online cloud to our local machines. we've used some git commands such as:
* `git clone`
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m`
* `git push`

at the end we've learned about VSCode and how to write markdown language in term of using it in documentations as we are doing right now!

Markdown is used to document on github usually.

then we've been assined to read an article about the programmer mindset, I real it all and I've learned a lot from. the article was written by [Huseyin Polat Yuruk][1].

Basically what I've learned is to put my targets infront of me, and the target is always to serve the purpose of the building the software am building and make as simple as it could be. so other developers would understand it and for it to be easier to fix in the future, I've also learned to never make assumptions. it is never helpful to write the code in a smart complex way and flex my skills over writing a simple flexible one that would serve the same desirable experience.

Also I should be consistent and divide my project to smaller pieces while working, never to underestimate the project, and to never waste time! **don't**! reinvent and do automation whenever possible.

Lastly I really enjoyed reading the big expiernced programmers and non-programmers quotes in the article, what I've liked the most is bill gates one:  

>Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
â€” ***Bill Gates***

So it's not about write much of code but about making it valuable instead.
